# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project the lane lines in images and videos have been detected using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

Major files in this project:

* test_images - Containing images used in the project
* test_videos - Containing videos used in the project 
* test_images_output - Output images with lane lines detected
* test_videos_output - Output videos with lane lines detected
